# server-2

This is the compute node of the PCC system.

## Version 0.001, the first prototype

This is the compute node directly created by the default configuration of
openpcc and confidentsecurity/confidentcompute.

This will use vllm as the LLM runtime without any NVIDIA acceleration or
other further optimizations.

Further changes for optimization, flexibility, or rebasing on TAOS-D will be
done in later versions.
