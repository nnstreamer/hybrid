# hybrid
Private Cloud Compute System, Serving NNStreamer Pipelines, LLMs, Agents. Yet Another Spin-Off! This is a server image creation &amp; deployment service, combining other open source packages.
NNStreamer pipeline support is planned but not yet implemented in this version.

This is a temporary project name. Suggest a better name!


# Purpose

This is a basis for PCC-related research; e.g., context streaming. This is (at least for now) not for actual service deployment.
